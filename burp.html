						<h2>OWASP Juice Shop - Burp Suite</h2>
						<p><b>For this exercise I've used Burp suite to exploit some of the most common web application
							vulnerabilities. Burp Suite Professional is one of the most popular penetration testing and vulnerability finder tools,
							and is often used for checking web application security. “Burp,” as it is commonly known,
							is a proxy-based tool used to evaluate the security of web-based applications and do hands-on
							testing. OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web 
							application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a
							guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top 
							Ten along with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!</b></p>
						</p>
						<h2>Outcome</h2>
						<p><b>I've run the Burp software on a Kali OS hosted on Virtual Machine (VM Workstation 16).
							Upon completion of the exercise I had a good understanding of the major web app threats and vulnerabilities, HTTP protocols and 
							fundamental networking basics.
							I was also able to use some of the fundamental tools in Burp suite,
							such as: Proxy, Intruder and Header. I’ve injected malicious SQL data,
							I’ve bruteforce the admin password and performed a XSS attack.</b>

						<h2>OWASP Top 10</h2>
						<p><b> OWASP Top 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web 
							application security. It represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web applications.
							Companies should adopt this document and start the process of ensuring that 
							their web applications minimize these risks. Using the OWASP Top 10 is perhaps 
							the most effective first step towards changing the software development culture 
							within your organization into one that produces more secure code.</b></p>
						</p>
						<h2>Topics I've touched in this exercise:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Injection</b></li>
							<li><b>Broken Authentication</b></li>
							<li><b>Sensitive Data Exposure</b></li>
							<li><b>Broken Access Control</b></li>
							<li><b>Cross-Site Scripting XSS</b></li>
