						<h2>Wireshark Forensic</h2>
						<p><b>In a scenario where our machine has been hacked by an anonymous threat actor, I have been 
                            given a .pcap file to analyse in order to determinate what happenend. To do so, I’ve made use
                            of wireshark, a famous network protocol analyzer. The vulnerable machine and the .pcap file are 
                            provided by the THM learning platform. I’ve run the wireshark software on a Kali OS using a virtual 
                            machine, VM Workstation 16, hosted my own machine. I could connect to the THM networn via OpenVPN.
                            In the second part of the exercise I’ve hacked my way back to the exploited machine, I performed a
                            privilege escalation and eventually I captured a Flag hidden in the fie system.

					
						</b></p>
						<h2>Outcome</h2>
						<p><b>This is one of a series of exercises and studies I have conducted to expand my knowledge in cyber 
                            security defence and incident response. At the end of the exercise I was able to read and analyze a simple 
                            .pcap file, I have a good understaning of the different traffic, protocols, the multilayer data structure 
                            and the informations that is possible to retrieve by them. I’m able to navigate and utilize some of the
                             basic wireshark tools and modules like filters, basic packet dissection, vilsualize TCP and UDP streams etc.. 
                            I also strengthened my knowledge in password bruteforcing, backdoor installing and privilege escalation.

						<h2>What is packet analysis?</h2>
						
						<p><b>Packet capture (PCAP) analysis is the process of obtaining and analyzing individual data packets 
                            that travel through your network.
                            PCAP analytics tools allow to consistently record traffic data at multiple OSI layers.
                            In terms of Security Data packets can serve as an important component of network security monitoring.
                            PCAP analysis tools help you to automate and visualize traffic patterns, so you can identify security 
                            threats as soon as they arise. For instance, packet capture 
                            analysis shows real-time network traffic data that can quickly show a spike in unauthorized activity</b></p> 

                        <h2>Wireshark</h2>
                        <p><b>Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, 
                            analysis, software and communications protocol 
                            development, and education. Originally named Ethereal, the project was renamed Wireshark in May 2006.
                            Wireshark "understands" the structure (encapsulation) of different 
                            networking protocols (see picture below). It can parse and display the fields, along with their meanings as specified by
                             different networking protocols. Wireshark uses
                             pcap to capture packets, so it can only capture packets on the types of networks that pcap supports.
