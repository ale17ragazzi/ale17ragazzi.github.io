						<h2>MS SC-900 / MS SC-200</h2>
						<p><b>During my studies related to the Microsoft SC-900 and SC-200 exams, I came across 
                            extensive documentation and many interactive guides that gave me the chance to understand 
                            the efficacy of an integrated SIEM-XDR security solution in a modern SOC environment. 
                            I was able not only to gain fundamental theoretical knowledge 
                            but also to test these solutions myself in real-world scenarios.
                            For this writeup/walkthrough, I chose an interactive guide that demonstrates how Microsoft 365 Defender
                            with XDR capabilities and Microsoft Sentinel enable organizations to monitor, detect, protect and respond
                            to threats and attacks.

                        </b>
						<h2>Outcome</h2>
							<p><b>Upon complition of the exercise I developed a solid understanding of what some of the duties 
                                and responsabilities of a SOC analyst (Tier 1) can look like. Apart from the use of proprietary software/solutions, these resources allowed 
                                me to understand how to investigate alerts and incidents, share threat intelligence, how to apply 
                                quick remediation steps, and finally how to correlate different alert/incidents to understand the 
                                root cause of an attack and its scope using an integrated SIEM-XDR solution.</p></b>
